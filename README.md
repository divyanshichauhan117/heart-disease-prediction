# Heart Disease Prediction: A Complete Machine Learning Project
# Project Overview
This comprehensive machine learning project develops an intelligent system for predicting heart disease risk using clinical patient data. The system leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze 13 key medical parameters and provide accurate cardiac risk assessments, serving as a valuable tool for healthcare professionals and early disease detection.
Project Objectives

Primary Goal: Create a reliable predictive model for heart disease detection
Clinical Impact: Enable early intervention and preventive care
Technical Achievement: Compare multiple ML algorithms to identify the best-performing model
User Experience: Provide an intuitive interface for healthcare professionals

Dataset and Features
